# Face-Recognition-using-OpenCV
Face Recognition comes under image processing. The goal of "Face Recognition" is to determine if there are any faces in the image or video. If multiple faces are present, each face is enclosed by a bounding box and thus we can find the location of the face in the image. A face recognition system can be useful in terms of security too. Like we can install it in any confidential area and only a few authorized people can gain access. It is built by an open-source library for computer vision i.e. OpenCV which is defined as the library which is widely used for computer vision purpose.
